- JAX-RS Application Refactored :=

Support for JAX-RS Application has been improved in order to support the use-cases described in the specification and summarized on the JBoss AS 7.1 JAX-RS Reference Guide

With this work done, the following use-cases are now supported:
* Defining a subclass of *javax.ws.rs.core.Application* annotated with *@javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath*
* Defining a subclass of *javax.ws.rs.core.Application* with or without *@javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath* annotation, and configuring/overriding the Application Path in the web deployment descriptor using the subclass as the servlet name
Defining the Application in the web deployment descriptor only, using *javax.ws.rs.core.Application* as the servlet-name.
