Context and Dependency Injection (CDI) tooling allows you to easily add and work with the CDI programming model 
for your web-based applications. JBoss Tools / JBoss Developer Studio helps you add CDI support to existing projects 
and create new projects with the CDI wizard. The tooling also provides you with validation, code completion and hyperlink navigation.
