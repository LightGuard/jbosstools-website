JBoss Tools for OpenShift offers a feature complete environment to work with OpenShift. 
From developing to deploying, JBoss Tools provides you a fully fledged environment for your
project and aligns with the standard workflows within Eclipse. Using the tooling, you can create 
and configure your remote application container, deploy your application, stream remote logs
into your local console and access your data and remotely debug the running application thanks to ssh port-forwarding.
